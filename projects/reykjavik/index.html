      The Reykjavik Index for Leadership
      measures the extent to which men and
      women are viewed equally in terms of
      the suitability of individuals for positions
      of power. The Index runs from 0 to
      100; a score of 100 means that across
      society, there is complete agreement
      that men and women are equally suited
      to leadership in all sectors.
